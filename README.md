# gdb-rsp-parser
gdb's remote serial protocol python parser 

This is a parser for the GDB's Remote Serial Protocol (RSP) I have written for a CTF I solved. It can parse most of the commands and display them on the console. 
Note: this parser was made for *raw* hex data. I originally used a wireshark tcp session. The input file should be inserted in the open function ("<yourfilehere>")
  
It supports most of the commands. If you have any suggestions, please send me a message or create a new issue.
